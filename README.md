WordPress Project Management
============================

A theme and plugin pair to turn [WordPress][wp] into your project management solution.

[wp]: http://wordpress.org/

## Why
[Three years ago](http://developdaly.com/wordpress/wordpress-for-project-management/) I started discussion about doing project management with WordPress, and three years later I'm actually doing something about it... because there is still no good solution.

## The entire solution is in the repository

Simply checkout this repository and you're ready. You don't need to worry about a database or anything! The purpose is mainly because this project requires a plugin and a theme (or more). Keeping both projects in sync is necessary. Further, a shared database is really helpful.

## Get involved and learn more

See [WordPress Project Management](http://production.pm.developdaly.com/) in action. We would love collaborators, so ping [Patrick Daly](https://github.com/developdaly) to get collaborator access to this repository.
